rfGallery is a very simple photos gallery written in PHP.  
It only uses the filesystem to know which photos to show, no database
is used. 

It does not generate thumbnails for you. You have to generate the
thumbnails by yourself. A sample script to recursively generate photos
thumbnails using imagemagick is provided in the utils/ folder.

It uses the jQuery plugin yoxview <http://www.yoxigen.com/yoxview/> to
display slideshow of your photos.

Some graphic files used come from the Open Icon Library <http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/>

REQUIREMENTS
------------
A web server with php5 installed and working

INSTALLATION
------------
You simply have to put it in an apache virtual host with index.php as DirectoryIndex.
Here is an example of apache2 configuration for this tool to work:

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAdmin webmaster@fairy-project.org
	ServerName www.fairy-project.org
	ServerAlias www

	DocumentRoot /srv/www/photos
	DirectoryIndex index.php

	<Directory /srv/www/photos>
		Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
		AllowOverride Indexes
		Order allow,deny
		allow from all
	</Directory>

	ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/rfgallery-error.log

	# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
	# alert, emerg.
	LogLevel warn

	CustomLog /var/log/apache2/rfgallery-access.log combined
	ServerSignature Off
</VirtualHost>


CONFIGURATION
-------------

All you have to do is to setup the photo and thumbnails folder in the
config.php

$PHOTOS_DIR = "photos";
$THUMBS_DIR = "thumbs";

The path is relative to the document root

Folders are treated as albums and, as some tests are base on filenames,
every .jpg file in a folder is a photo of the album. The thumbnail folder
architecture and filenames must be equivalent to the photo one. If a photo
is available under $PHOTOS_DIR/album1/subalbum1/myphoto.jpg, its thumbnail
must be stored in $THUMBS_DIR/album1/subalbum1/myphoto.jpg. If you use
the provided shell script to generate the thumbnails folder, everything will
be done automatically.


* You can also modify the name of the gallery home page in the same file.
define(HOME_PAGE_NAME, "Photos");

This name is used for the page titles and as the first navigation link.

* You can change the copyright notice by changing the define:
define(FOOTER_MESSAGE, "Gallery provided by <a href=\"http://git.fairy-project.org/?p=rfGallery.git\">rfGallery</a>");


SECURITY
--------
No authentication mecanism is provided with rfGallery. If you wan't to limit
access to your gallery, you must use apache authentication mechanism.
You can add a .htaccess file at the document root.
For example:

AuthName rfGallery
AuthUserFile /home/photos/www/.htpasswd
AuthType Basic
require valid-user

and use htpasswd to create the .htpasswd file.  Please note that if
you do not use https, login and password are transmitted uncrypted!
